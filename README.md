# Search algorithms made in Python 3
This project is made to help students/and or professionals to understand the beauty of searching.

The algorithms are separated into categories, and it will only rely on already included Python packages.

# FAQ

### Why are the needle and haystack converted to uppercase?
Uppercase char's has a lower decimal value. F.x **a** has a dec value of 97 but on the other hand, **A** has a dec value of 65.

### Why not use other packages/extensions like gmpy2?
That should be up to the end user, if he/she/them would like to use those.
I do use packages/extensions in projects, but because I'm making this to help the end user to understand searching
algorithms, I've would rather be more creative.
